  page

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started using the hosted application link in Netlify

URL: https://phenomenal-nasturtium-709b0d.netlify.app

Start with registering a user. You will get an error messages if you have done something wrong. Only users with a @stud.noroff.no email are allowed to register. 
When testing this site, you can create a random user email but is must end with @stud.noroff.no. Here is an example: 
mytestuser@stud.noroff.no

If you are struggling use this test user to log in directly:
username: usertest1
e-mail address: usertest1@stud.noroff.no
password:Pass12345!

It is also important to be aware that supported image use on this page is: jpg, png and jpeg. It's controlled through regex and the user will be informed if a none valid image format is being used.

### How to start the project locally

- Download this repository with your preferred method OR clone the repo
- If you decided to download the zip-file please extract it
- Now you need to install the dependencies. Run: npm install

  and you can view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
